# Monitor Lizard
A python based command line security tool for monitoring the network for rogue DHCP servers.

## Installation
Simply download monitorlizard.py from `https://github.com/osm6495/Monitor-Lizard/blob/main/monitorlizard.py`

### Prerequisites:
This script requires Scapy to run. It can be installed with pip:

    pip install scapy

## Usage

For a manual simply use:

    monitorlizard.py --help

## Roadmap
I would like to make this tool more useful and have it work as a full intrusion detection script, but there are already open source scripts that can do that, like Snort or Zeke. I also considered having the script use machine learning for intrusion detection, and might use this in the future, but there are also already open source scripts for that use as well, such as Stratosphere Linux IPS (SLIPS).
